    <h2 class="special-elite-regular">Getting here</h2>
    If you need any assistance with booking any transportation, please don't hesitate to contact us.
    <div></div>
    Depending on your chosen accommodation, there will be advice on how to get there on their websites etc. but as a general overview of options for getting to tyn Celyn and the surrounding areas, below is what we would recommend. 
    
    <span></span>
    <h3 class="style-bold special-elite-regular">What is the dress code for your wedding</h3>
    <span></span>
    The dress code for our wedding is 'Garden Party'. Think dressy casual, but comfortable
    <span></span>
    <h3 class="style-bold special-elite-regular">Is there anything that we shouldn't wear?</h3>
    
    <span></span>
    Tradition in Sweden dictates that the colours red, black or white shouldn't be worn at a wedding.    
    <span></span>
    <h3 class="style-bold special-elite-regular">Will the ceremony and reception be indoors or outdoors?</h3>
    
    <span></span>
    The celebrations will be taking place in and around a marquee (weather permitting); we recommend flat-soled shoes or wedges to avoid sinking into the grass. The reception will be held within the marquee with outdoor seating area available on the grass.    </h1>   
 
    <h3 class="style-bold special-elite-regular">What will the weather be like in Wales?</h3>
    
    <span></span>
    Excellent question. July is right in the middle of summer in Wales and with it comes some of the best weather making it a peak time to visit. Average temperatures are typically around 17â„ƒ which is the warmest month, with more than 16 hours of daylight. This is Wales after all and with unpredictable weather, there is still the possibility of rain. Suggestion is to check the forecast a few days before travel, and we'd suggest brining some layers for the evening.   </section>   
  
    <h3 class="style-bold special-elite-regular">Can I bring a plus one?</h3>
    
    <span></span>
    Unfortunately, we have a strict guest list. Our celebration is strictly RSVP only. We will only be able to accommodate those listed on your wedding invitation.
    <h3 class="style-bold special-elite-regular">Will food be served at the reception?</h3>
    
    <span></span>
    A sit down meal will be served at 4pm at the reception, and an evening snack around 8:30pm. 


    If you have any dietary requirements, please let us know when filling in the RSVP.
    <h3 class="style-bold special-elite-regular">Do you have a wedding gift list?</h3>
    Your presence at our wedding is gift enough, but, should you wish to give a gift as well, a cash gift to put towards our home renovation would be greatly appreciated.
