        <h3 class="special-elite-regular">The night before â€“ Friday 26th July 2024</h3>
         As some of you will have travelled to join us and to make as much of the time we have with you, weâ€™d love it if you were able to join us at one of the local pubs for a few drinks. 
         The Goat, Maerdy is somewhere we have spent time with friends and family, just donâ€™t ask us about the night of the Wales v South Africa rugby match of 2021!
          <span></span>This will be a very informal get together, where we will be there from 7.30pm. The pub serves traditional pub food, with last orders being taken at 8.30pm. 
          If youâ€˜re staying locally, please let us know and we can help you find a taxi. The Goat Inn, Maerdy, LL21 0NR

          <h3 class="special-elite-regular">The Big Day â€“ Saturday 27th July 2024</h3>
          
          
          The day will be a celebration of our wedding, but also a chance for us to get together with our favourite people for a party. 
          
          
          Weâ€™re looking forward to a relaxing day with very few formalities, so have opted for a â€˜Garden Partyâ€™ (sommarfin) theme where we can make the most of the setting and hopefully the weather. To fit in with the theme, the dress code is 'garden partyâ€™.
          
          
          Weâ€™d suggest that you have a light lunch before arriving as food will be served later in the day.
