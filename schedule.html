        <h3 class="special-elite-regular">The night before â€“ Friday 26th July 2024</h3><span></span>
         As some of you will have travelled to join us and to make as much of the time we have with you, weâ€™d love it if you were able to join us at one of the local pubs for a few drinks. 
          <span></span>The Goat, Maerdy is somewhere we have spent time with friends and family, just donâ€™t ask us about the night of the Wales v South Africa rugby match of 2021!
          <span></span>This will be a very informal get together, where we will be there from 7.30pm. The pub serves traditional pub food, with last orders being taken at 8.30pm. 
          The Goat Inn, Maerdy, LL21 0NR
          
          If youâ€˜re staying locally, please let us know and we can help you find a taxi. 
        
          <h3 class="special-elite-regular">The Big Day â€“ Saturday 27th July 2024</h3>
          
          
          The day will be a celebration of our wedding, but also a chance for us to get together with our favourite people for a party. 
          
          
          Weâ€™re looking forward to a relaxing day with very few formalities, so have opted for a â€˜Garden Partyâ€™ theme where we can make the most of the setting and hopefully the weather. To fit in with the theme, the dress code is 'garden partyâ€™.
          
          
          Weâ€™d suggest that you have a light lunch before arriving as food will be served later in the day.
          
          
         <span></span> The order of the day will be as follows:
          
          <span></span>
          1pm		Welcome drinks
          <span></span>
